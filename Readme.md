# 3D-visualisation of GIS MapInfo files using OpenGL.

University diploma project written in 1997-1999 by Sergey Baskov.
Scientific supervisor - [Petr Darakhvelidze](https://www.amazon.com/Books-Peter-Darakhvelidze/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3APeter%2BDarakhvelidze) 

The project involves Delaunay triangulation in computational geometry, the development of custom data structures such as LinkedList, and other components for 3D graphics using OpenGL. It includes Bresenham's algorithm for line drawing and algorithms for calculating invisible areas on terrain. The project also features 3D navigation along a trajectory while observing a selected point.

NB! Neither Pascal nor Delphi provides built-in implementations for some of the common data structures we use daily, so I developed my own. In the file Geom1.pas, you can find my implementation of a linked list, which may serve as a simple example to understand how these structures work.

P.S. There is a bug - incorrect text encoding because of a lot of time spent - more than 20 years
P.P.S. In bottom panel you can see very old icons: Windows95, IE, Far Manager, Dial-Up, Paint, ICQ, WinAMP,...
