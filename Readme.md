# 3D-visualisation of GIS MapInfo files using OpenGL.

University diploma project written in 1997-1999

Delaunay triangulation, computational geometry, custom data structures such as LinkedList and other, 3D, OpenGL, Bresenham's algorithm for lines drawing; calculation invisible places on terrain; 3D flying by traektory with observing selected point...

NB! Neither Pascal nor Delphi have a built-in implementation of some of the data structures we use every day, so I wrote my own implementation. In the file Geom1.pas, you can see my implementation of a linked list, which may help you to understand how it works in a very simple example.

Delphi 5

P.S. There is a bug - incorrect text encoding because of a lot of time spent - more than 20 years
P.P.S. In bottom panel you can see very old icons: Windows95, IE, Far Manager, Dial-Up, Paint, ICQ, WinAMP,...
